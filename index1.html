							<h3>Zhovkiv Castle</h3>
							<p>Zhovkiv Castle was built by the architect Pavel Shchasly on the order of Hetman Stanislav Zholkivskyi in 1594-1605. At the beginning of its existence, the castle was home to the family of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, and in the second half of the 17th century it was the residence of King Jan III Sobieski, it remembers ambassadors and crowned persons from all over Europe. The castle is the largest building in Zhovkva. Four three-tier corner flanking towers and four two-story buildings along the perimeter are interconnected by closed battle galleries. There is a large inner courtyard inside the castle, and small courtyards at the ends of the buildings near the corner towers. In the depth of the courtyard, opposite the entrance, there is a palace building with a two-story open gallery. Two small courtyards attached to the palace building are separated from the main courtyard by high walls. The entrance gate with a four-tiered tower over the gate is located along the axis of the castle; an embankment dam and a wooden bridge across a wide brick defensive moat with water led to it from the Market Square. Part of the bridge was arched and used to close the castle gate. Initially, the castle had rather strict external forms. The castle reached its peak during the reign of Jan III Sobieski, who in 1674 turned the castle into a rich royal residence (architects P. Beber, A. Lozzi). Beautiful park ensembles were laid by Jan Sobieski near the castle.</p>

							<h3>The Collegiate Church of St. Lawrence</h3>
							<p>The Zhovki shrines belong to the most important monuments associated with John III. Located near the castle, on the western side of the market of the Collegiate Church of St. Lawrence (1606-1618), is the mausoleum of the Zholkivski, Danylovych and Sobieski families. Inside the church, there are restored late-Renaissance epitaphs of Hetman Stanislaus Zholkevski (1546-1620) and his son Jan (1591-1623), as well as Regina of Gerbiti (circa 1564-1626), wife of Stanislav Zholkevski, Sofia of Zholkevski (circa 1590-1634), wife of Yan Danylovych, grandmother of the future king. The tombstones of Yakov Sobieski (1588-1646) and Stanislav Danylovych (about 1609-1636) - the father and uncle of John III - are placed in the presbinterium on the side of the nave. The latter were executed in 1692-1693 from the king's fund by his court sculptor Andrii Schulter. On the wall of the northern shoulder of the epitaph, the crypts of the Sobieski princes: Constantine (1680-1726) and Jacob (1667-1737), as well as Princess Maria Carolina de Boulion (1697-1740), were built by the Lviv sculptor Paris Philippi in 1862. The ashes of Hetman Stanislav Zholkevski, as well as members of the Zholkevski, Danylovych and Sobieski families, rest in two sarcophagi in the dungeons of the church. The crypt was restored in 1905-1908, as the table in the church informs us. From the fund of John III, the walls of the church were enriched with three huge canvases representing the battles with the Turks near Hotim, Vienna and Parkan. They supplemented an earlier performance showing the victory of Hetman Zholkivskyi over the Russian troops near Klushyn (now all in the assembly at the Lviv Art Gallery in Olesk). On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Vienna, in 1883, a commemorative plaque honoring the memory of Jan III Sobieski was placed in the nave of the church. There are also shields with the coats of arms of Poland, Lithuania and Sobieski, placed on the walls of the transept under the vault. On the next anniversary of the Battle of Vienna, in 1903, on the square in front of the town hall, between the castle and the church, a monument to John III was erected, which has not been preserved today.</p>

							<h3>Synagogue</h3>
							<p>King Jan III Sobieski gave the Jewish community a stone from the royal quarries and loaned 800 zlotys. The synagogue was built in 1692-1700. The royal architect Petro Beber took part in the construction of the synagogue. The location of the synagogue next to the defensive wall and the city gate determined its defensive character (thick walls, high windows, defensive galleries and loopholes under the roof). The interior of the prayer hall is decorated with an arcuate frieze of 12 small arches on each wall, with original polychrome paintings and scriptural inscriptions (partially preserved). The rich stucco decoration of the altar niche has been preserved on the eastern wall. On each side of the facade there are three window openings at the height of the second floor, a high parapet, decorated with a hollow arcature belt with loopholes, which closes the structure of the roof and the defensive gallery, the parapet ends with an attic with turrets on the corners, which has been preserved only on the western side. The white stone portal of the entrance to the prayer hall has been preserved on the western side. In the 18th century a western two-story and a southern one-story annex and buttresses were added to the synagogue. During the Second World War, in June 1941, German troops blew up the synagogue, as a result of which the ceilings and the interior of the temple were destroyed. In 1955-56, the synagogue was partially restored. The synagogue is one of the largest synagogues in Europe, it is considered one of the most beautiful Jewish Renaissance temples, and it is an outstanding monument of defensive construction of the 17th century. In 1999, the Zhovkiv Synagogue was included in the list of 100 world monuments that are in danger (a program of the World Monuments Fund, New York).</p>
